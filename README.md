# Gateway drug: loops + conditionals
Loops allow us to offload responsibility onto our computer.\
It will do things multiple times without us specifying _explicitly_ each time. Kinda nice.\
Conditionals make our programs "smart". We have the ability to execute certain bits of code based on conditions. Also cool.\
Combine the two & you've got the secret sauce of far more complicated programs.

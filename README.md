# Gateway drug: loops + conditionals
Loops allow us to offload responsibility onto our computer.\
It will do things multiple times without us specifying _explicitly_ each time. Kinda nice.\
Conditionals make our programs "smart". We have the ability to execute certain bits of code based on conditions. Also cool.\
Combine the two & you've got the secret sauce of far more complicated programs.

### Not new != easy
These topics aren't new, they'll just take practice & patience.\
Let's review the loops and conditionals we've seen thus far.
###### while loops
```

  // will run "while" condition is true
  
  while (condition) {
    do this thing;
    update this condition;
  }
```
Side note: what I've just done above is called pseudocode.\
It is like writing the draft of your english essay, omit the fanciness & just get the ideas on the page.
###### for loops
```
  for (setup variable; condition; update condition;) {
    do this thing;
  }
```
###### if/else
```  
  if (condition1) {
    do this thing;
    if (condition3) {
      do sum'n crazy;
    }
  }
  else if (condition2){
    do this thing;
  }
  else {
    do this thing;
  }
```
###### :eyes:&nbsp; 
be clear about which statements will execute under what conditions!\
_exempli gratia_: if condition1 & condition2 are both true, what will happen?

### Noodles & sauce
Genuinely, you now have the #skills to tackle pretty complicated programs.\
This is sort of like the algebra of computer programming. It's pretty basic but you can also make the general theory of relativity with it.\
You've got the tools, time to practice & get creative.
